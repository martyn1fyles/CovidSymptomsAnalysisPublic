Examples folder readme:
In this folder, we provide code to produce synthetic datasets upon, upon which all the analysis techniques can be performed and demonstrated.

The categories assinged to symptoms represent blocks of symptoms that vary according to the true cluster.

Folder layout:
* generate_example_data_*.R - generates synthetic datasets. There are two versions with different numbers of clusters.
* Analysis folder - code to perform model selection and analysis
* Inputs - contains the synthetic dataset, and manually assigned categories (1 for each version of the synthetic data scripts).
* Outputs - outputs produced from code in the analysis folder
* Visualisation - code to produce visualisations of the outputs
* Figures - saved images of the output visualisations
